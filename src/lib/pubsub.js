/**
 * Publish-Subscribe Pattern class.
 * 
 * Publishers categorize messages into classes that are received by subscribers.
 * Subscribers express interest in one or more classes and only receive messages that are of interest.
 * 
 * **Properties** : 
 * 
 * - `events` : the event message object.
 * 
 * The event object properties are classes of messages, to which subscribers listen to.
 * Each class contains one or more callbacks lambda functions, which are executed when publishing events of this class.
 * 
 * Therefore, several subscribers can subscribe to the same event with a different callback.
 * 
 * **Specifics** :
 * 
 * - A subscriber can subscribe to multiple events at once, but with the same callback.
 * - An event can have multiple callbacks registered.
